The assignment
Your assignment is to build a web service. The main API endpoint of your service should display
a random quote, retrieved from a remote source (for example https://api.quotable.io/random or
https://dummyjson.com/quotes). Every request should respond with another random quote. All
other requirements are up to you. Be as creative as you like, impress us! In general try to
approach this assignment as a production project (within reason).
To give you some ideas, here are some sample user stories you could incorporate into your
application:
- Implement multiple API’s. For example REST, GraphQL or GRPC.
- Allow quotes to be liked �(via an API call).
- Tweak the random quote logic to prioritize showing highly rated quotes to new users.
- Find quotes comparable to the currently shown quote.
Preferably we'd like to see the following technologies used: Java 14+, Spring boot, Gradle. Feel
free to propose innovative new solutions or frameworks to use.
Try to build at least two of the stories mentioned above, or comparable features you came up
with. Remember, it should be an application that shows off your coding skills and you can be
proud of!
